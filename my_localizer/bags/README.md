The first bag `my_ac109_1.bag` contains our particles behaving on the ac109_1 map and bag file playback. Initially, we set the points to be the same as the map pose (according to the april tags). As time progressed, our particles clustered in 2 different groups, and neither group was in the correct position. Therefore, it was really hard for our particles to resample close to the real result. However, the two clusters were able to move close to the real position at the end of the run.

The second bag `my_ac109_2.bag` contains our particles behaving on the ac109_2 map and bag file playback. In this run, our particles aligned very well with the actual position. The only time it struggled was when there were corner turns, at which point the average became offset with the actual position.
